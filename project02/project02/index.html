      <h2>Chapter Debrief</h2>
         <p id="q1">HTML is case insensitive while JavaScript is not. Best practice is to use lowercase for HTML. This makes it a bit odd to use camel case within the id attribute's value. Is it best to think of those ID attribute values as JavaScript keys within the HTML?</p>
         <p id="q2">I had trouble finding my errors, but I waited until after I had finished typing all of the code for the Chapter 2 example. I know I need to start checking for errors much sooner. When do you first start debugging? How often?</p>
         <p id="q3">Given each ID value on a webpage must be unique, how do large websites keep track of all those unique values? PS I really appreciate how detailed and forthcoming you answer our questions. You even approach the questions and answers from different perspectives, which is awesome.</p>

      <h2>Review Questions:</h2>
         <p id="p7">The JavaScript in this project runs after the rest of the body of the HTML code is rendered in the browser.</p>
         <p id="p8">The + is used for concatenation. This is an available method to use for both strings and numbers. However, JavaScript will automatically convert the number to a string if these two different primitive data types are attempted to be concatenated. When multiplication is used between a string and number datatype, there is not a way for JavaScript to handle that, so NaN, not-a-number, is output as the value.</p>
         <p id="p9">TextContent is part of the Document Object Model. It uses straight text and is faster then the innerHTML option. InnerHTML parses the string passed as HTML, so it takes a step longer for the browser to render the result.</p>
         <p id="p10">JavaScript is built to automatically insert a semicolon to the end of a JavaScript statement automatically. This is very different from other programming languages. It is not necessary, but makes for easier reading if a semicolon is typed at the end of each statement. </p>
         <p id="p11">It is okay to break a statement onto two lines in JavaScript when a statement is very long. In this situation, break the line after an operator, and no special character is necessary. To do it within a text string, close the string with it's matching closing quote and use the + operator to join the enclosed string on the next line.</p>
