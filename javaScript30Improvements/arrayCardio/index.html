         Things I did:
            The only html elements in the original file were the head, body and a paragraph. The rest were added.
            Instead of printing to the console, I created paragraph elements that will chnage using the javascript textContent method.
            I did this for a list of inventors and the mapping of inventors.
            There was no css at all in the original file. All of it was added.
