      <h2>Chapter Debrief</h2>
         <p id="q1">Why do some of JavaScript's Built In Objects have "properties" that are treated as methods in other languages? For example, stringVarJS.length; vs stringVarCpp.length();</p>
         <p id="q2">Is the Object Constructor more like a blank Object than a template? I think at the beginning, I was thinking of the object constructure more like a declared constructor (like a defined object with a constructor)...less like a completely blank thing. </p>
         <p id="q3">How often is the innerHTML used now? Probably not at companies, but is it still a large problem?</p>

               <td>This is not valid from a best practices standpoint. Generally built in objects have the first character of their name capitalized. It is also good practice to use camel case when naming variables, so JCCC in all lower case would be better.</td>

            <tr>
      			<th><code class="javascript">1jccc</code></th>
      			<td class="yesOrNo">no</td>

      			<td class="yesOrNo">no</td>

Camel case places a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word within a variable name. This makes the names easier to read and it is easier to be consistent throughout your code.</td>

      		<tr>
      			<th><code class="javascript">StreetAddress</code></th>
      			<td class="yesOrNo">no</td>
      			<td>It is not good practice to capitalize both the first and and the words after within a variable name that is made up of more than one word. It is better to use camel casing, which only capitalizes the first letter of every word after the first. This ensures consistency, readability and avoids confusion with built in objects.</td>
      		</tr>
      		<tr>
      			<th><code class="javascript">street-Address</code></th>

      <h2>Array Review Questions:</h2>
         <p id="p10">There is no real difference. Just be consistent.</p>
         <p id="p11">The textContent is a much more straight forward solution. It passes a string into the HTML element. The innerHTML should not be used for two reasons. One, it's not as straight forward. Do you really need to insert and entire element into the code to pass a string value? Seems a bit much. Second, it creates a security vulnerability from the end user standpoint. InnerHTML can be used to insert unwanted and harmful javascript into the user's browser. This has been exploited for malicious purposes in the past and still can create issues if used irresponsibility.</p>
         <p id="p12">I definitely think referencing an array value is much faster and may be used again and again later in the code. It also ensures consistency, because if there is a type-o in one of the months...it only needs to be fixed once, at the source.</p>

      <h2>Function Review Questions</h2>
         <p id="f1">A function without parameters can be called with empty parenthesis following the variable name, then ending with a semicolon: <code class="javascript">showTotal();</code>.</p>
         <p id="f2">The code, <code class="javascript">showTotal(2,10);</code> can be used to pass the 2 for the tax and 10 for the total parameters.</p>
         <p id="f3">The code, <code class="javascript">showTotal(stateTax, totalBeforeTax);</code> can be used to pass the stateTax variable for the tax and the totalBeforeTax variable for the total parameters.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Variable Scope Questions</h2>
         <p id="s1">The <code class="javascript">"use strict"</code> statement at the beginning of the javascript file forces the developer to explicitly declare all variables.</p>
         <p id="s2">There are two ways to create a global variable. The first is declaring the variable in the javascript file that is not inside of a function. This will declare the variable at the global, or window-level. The second way is to not use the keyword <code class="javascript">var</code> prior to the variable name.</p>
         <p id="s3">The keyword used to create a block-level variable is <code class="javascript">var</code>. The <code class="javascript">let</code> and <code class="javascript">const</code> keywords are also used to declare variables.</p>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th><span class="keyword">dot notation</span></th>
				<td>Dot notation allows access to the properties or methods of an object by placing a period (.) after the object name, followed by the property or method that needs to be accessed.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th><span class="keyword">constructor notation</span></th>
				<td>Using the <code class="javascript"> new Object();</code> notation after the declared object name allows the developer to create a blank object that can then be appended with the specific key/values for it.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th><span class="keyword">this</span></th>
				<td>The keyword this is used inside of functions and objects to refer to the specific instance of the object that is calling it. If used outside of a scope block, it refers to the window object.</td>

      <h2>User-Created Object Questions</h2>
         <p id="j1">Literal notation allows you to individually assign each property value within it  according to what the developer requires. This is ideal if you're just needing one specific object with values or methods that are specific to it.</p>
         <p id="j2">Constructor notation is highly efficient if you need to make a lot of instances of a single object. The constructor notation creates a sort of generic template for you to assign values as needed to create the object you need. This means you can tweak the objects differently, while making more than a few of them.</p>
         <p id="j3">If a function is created in the global scope, it is built where the window function is the highest and default object. When the keyword <b>this</b> is used within the function, it refers to the window object and will respond as such.</p>
         <p id="j4">When the function created is within an object, the keyword <b>this</b> refers to the object that is calling the function. It would NOT refer to the window object.</p>
