      <h2>How do HTML id and class attributes connect to CSS selectors?</h2>
      <ol>
         <li><code class="html">&lt;p id="xyz"&gt;</code>Item number xyz.<code class="html">&lt;/p&gt;</code> connects to what selector in the css? <code class="css">#xyz {}</code></li>
         <li>How many html elements may have the same <code class="html">id="xyz"</code> attribute value on a given page? Only one, unique id value may appear on one page.</li>
         <li><code class="html">&lt;p class="holidayItem"&gt;</code>Seasonal item for sale.<code class="html">&lt;/p&gt;</code> connects to what selector in the css? <code class="css">.holidayItem {}</code></li>
         <li>How many html elements have the same <code class="html"> class="holidayItem"</code> attribute value on a given page? There can be as few or as many as the developer requires.</li>

      <h2>Essential JavaScript best practices</h2>
      <ol>
   		<li>inline vs. embedded vs. external JavaScript using examples.
   		   <p>Pro: It is considered best practice to code an external JavaScript file that is externally linked to the web-page. This allows for re-usability, maintainability and clear organizational separation. It allows the developer to delay the execution of events until a certain thing occurs.</p>
   			<p>Con: Inline JavaScript is executed immediate when the page is rendered. This doesn't allows for user interaction if everything must be executed at once.</p>
   			<p>Code Example: Inline JavaScript is written between script tage: <code class="javascript">&lt;script&gt;put JavaScript here&lt;script&gt;</code> This is different from an externally referenced javascript file, which is included right before the closing html body tag as follows: <code class="javascript">&lt;script src="javaScriptTemplate.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
   		</li>
   		<li>indenting your code.
   			<p>Pro: Creates very easy to follow, clean and organized code. This is key for ease of use and maintainablity, especially if you're part of a team.</p>
   			<p>Con: Can be time consuming at first.</p>
   			<p>Code Example: Un-indented code...&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;Content&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</p>
   		</li>
   		<li>inserting code comments.
   			<p>Pro: Gives the code some context, especially if there are many sections that are doing different tasks. This is incredibly invaluable in a team setting, as well as for yourself.</p>
   			<p>Con: Takes time. Can get excessive if done without a critical eye.</p>
   			<p>Code Example: Use &lt;!-- Comment here --&gt; anywhere in the code that will help someone without any prior knowledge of the project for which the code was written.</p>
   		</li>
   	</ol>

      <h2>Java vs JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>What is the general purpose for each language?</li>
            <p>Java is a complied programming languages that can be used to build applications or for more backend processes</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that started as a way to interact with users of web pages. Since then, it has become useful in a range of ways, from making online browser games, web page based applications and even server side scripting.</p>
         <li>Strict vs loose variable typing - what does this mean as it relates to Java and JavaScript?<li>
            <p>Java is considered a strict language. This means that when variable are declared, the type of the variable must be explicitly stated. This variable type will not change for the entirety of the program, although the value of it may.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a loose variable typed language. This means that a variable type need not be declared, as JavaScript can keep track of all that for you. It also allows variables to change types as the program is written or interpreted.</p>
         <li>Where is the source code for each language complied or interpreted?</li>
            <p>Java is complied through a compiler. Often this is built in to the IDE a programmer is using. For instance, Visual Studio. Whereas, JavaScript is interpreted by the interpreter within the browser of the vistor.</p>
